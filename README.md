## Lowest Common Ancestor Part 1
The first part of this module consists of providing a solution to the Lowest Ancestor problem, assuming the Graph is structured as a "binary tree".
I wrote the solution in Python. As it is my first attempt using Python, the approach taken is inspired from the [geeksforgeeks implementation][https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/]. However, the
corresponding unit tests are code written fully by myself.
